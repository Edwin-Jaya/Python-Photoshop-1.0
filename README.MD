# Photoshop Python Version 1.0

## What it do?
   This application is able to help you adjust the brightness, contrast, and add an adjustable color filter to your picture. This program was made entirely with python to help me learning about image processing. Since i'm new to programming and especially image processing, there's a lot of challanges that i faced. Some of them was how to implement those features (brightness, contrast, color filter) to the photo and give an update everytimes the trackbar is change.

## Features
- [x] Adjust Brightness

## Features to implement in the future
- [ ] Adjusting shadow
