# Photoshop Python Version 1.0

## What it do?
This application is able to help you adjust the brightness, contrast, and add an adjustable color filter to your picture. This program was made entirely with python to help me learning about image processing. Since i'm new to programming world and especially image processing, there's a lot of challanges that i faced. Some of them was how to implement those features (brightness, contrast, color filter) to the photo and give an update everytimes the trackbar is change, and then there's a formula that i found online that i used for the brightness. I've been trying to find out where it came from, and how that formula was made but no luck (if you know, hit me up. :)).
